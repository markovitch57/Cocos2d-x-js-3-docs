Folder structure of Lua binding
===============================

Cocos2d-X Lua binding comes with the Cocos2d-X bundle, you could download it from our download page. After downloading, unzip it and you will see the following folder structure:

All Lua binding code are under the directory `cocos/scripting/lua-bindings/auto` and `cocos/scripting/lua-bindings/manual`. As the folder name says, the *auto* folder contains all the binding code generated by [bindings generator](https://github.com/cocos2d/bindings-generator)  and the *manual* folder contains all the manually written binding code. That's due to the limitations of bindings generator.  And there are also some glue Lua code lays in the *scrip* folder.That's all!

If you are curious about the implementation details, don't hesitate to dive into these files.
